### Prevent and troubleshoot runtime issues
    - Troubleshoot performance, security, and errors
	- implement tracing, logging, and debugging including IntelliTrace
	- enable and configure health monitoring including Performance Monitor
	- configure and use App Insights runtime telemetry

### Design an exception handling strategy
    - Handle exceptions across multiple layers
	- use MVC middleware to configure error handling
	- use different exception handling strategies for different environments
	- create and display custom error pages
	- configure a custom pipeline for error handling
	- handle first chance exceptions
	- configure and use App Insights
	- log application exceptions

### Test a web application
    - Create and run unit tests, for example, use the Assert class, create mocks and stubs
	- create and run web tests including using Browser Link
	- debug a web application in multiple browsers and mobile emulators
	- use Azure DevTest Labs
	- use Visual Studio Team Services

### Debug an Azure application
    - Collect diagnostic information by using Azure App Insights
	- choose log types, for example, event logs, performance counters, and crash dumps
	- stream logs directly to Visual Studio from a deployed site
