### Extra resources to help prepare for the exam:

#### ASP.NET Learning material

- Microsoft as a web site dedicated to [learning ASP.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/web)

### Microsoft learn

- Microsoft also launched a new site dedicated to learning with some Azure and [ASP.Net material](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/browse/?roles=developer&term=asp.net). Might worth a look...


#### Pluralsight

- Pluralsight as a great course on [ASP.Net](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aspnet-core-fundamentals/table-of-contents) by Scott Allen.  The course is updated regularly. | ★★★★★

- Repository of Pluralsight training from Microsoft [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/pluralsight)

#### New book reference ?

- Official exam ref book is very outdated and Microsoft does not recommend it anymore.  They now recommend this book [ASP.NET Core Application Development: Building an application in four sprints](https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/asp.net-core-application-development-building-an-application-9781509304066)  But since this book was written in 2016, not quite sure it is still up to date.

#### Blogs

- As for exam 70-480, there is some good information on babarian meets coding blog about [asp.net certification notes](https://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/wiki/asp-net-mvc/asp-net-mvc-certification/).  Just make sure you double check what is still valid with latest exam changes.

- You can also find some helpful material on [failed turing blog](http://failedturing.blogspot.com/2016/05/microsoft-exam-70-486-study-guide.html) but once again keep in mind it was written in 2016
